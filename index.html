<p id="nice">This website was made for Dakota Falcon. This is a website for top 5 animals.This is about what animals are the best and how they live and what they do and how they eat. I chose the cheetah as my top animal because it is fast and looks nice. I have always loved the cheetah and will always be my favorite animal.My second animal is the wolf because it is a choice that Dakota chose because he believes he is the wolf of Denver and likes wolves for their characteristics.The third animal the sloth because sloths are fun and I like how they look and they are cool like how they play with their hands and how lazy they are. The fourth animal the Kangaroo because i like how they hop and look nice and fluffy. Also because Kangaroo Jack was a good movie. The fifth animal the Panda because they are not that exciting but are cute. They just sit their and eat bamboo. The only reason they are on this list is because I like how they look and how fat they look it makes me laugh.
