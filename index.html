<p id="nice">This website was made for Dakota Falcon and all people who like animals. This is a website for top 5 animals.This is about what animals are the best and how they live and what they do and how they eat. Do not judge because this is my opinion. I chose the cheetah as my top animal because it is fast and looks nice. I have always loved the cheetah and will always be my favorite animal. I like how they also hunt animals and jump on them. They have spots also that make them look cool. My second animal is the wolf because it is a choice that Dakota chose because he believes he is the wolf of Denver and likes wolves for their characteristics. They are great animals and they hunt in packs so none of them dies and are in a pact. The Wolves also use brotherhood to live and die together and use their sharp teeth to kill animals.The third animal the sloth because sloths are fun and I like how they look and they are cool like how they play with their hands and how lazy they are. The fourth animal the Kangaroo because i like how they hop and look nice and fluffy. Also because Kangaroo Jack was a good movie. The fifth animal the Panda because they are not that exciting but are cute. They just sit their and eat bamboo. The only reason they are on this list is because I like how they look and how fat they look it makes me laugh. Pandas remind me of lazy couch potatoes. Then the sexiest animal of all is me and im to sexy to explain me.My hair is nice, my face is nice, my feet are nice, and everthing is nice. If you ever see me hit me up. If you see that picture of me and that hippo I look cool because you know why Im the animal. Also you see my boy the reptile Taos he is not sexy like me but still has some game.He is reptile and I am the wild sexy animal so watch out.
